It's that time of the year again: the exams have begun.
One of the most immediate questions facing any student taking a (written) exam is the following:

>In what order do I answer the questions?

The old adage dictates that one should answer the questions in increasing order of difficulty.
The reasoning is that if one struggles with a difficult question, then time constraints limit
one's ability to answer other, potentially easier questions. This may lead to lower grades.
In this post, I formally analyze this situation and show that this ancient wisdom actually holds
up pretty well.

Assume an exam consists of $$n$$ questions for which we have time at most $$T$$ to answer them all.
Each question awards us with a maximum number of points $$p_i > 0$$ if the question is answered perfectly.
However, how well we answer a given question within a certain amount of time depends on our mastery of the
course material. Denote our "mastery" of the material by $$\alpha \in [0,1]$$, where $$\alpha = 1$$ indicates
complete mastery and $$\alpha = 0$$ indicates no understanding of the material whatsoever.
Our mastery of the material yields a relationship between the number of points $$q_i$$ we can get as a function
of the time $$t$$ that we take to answer it:

$$
    q_i(t) = \frac{p_i}{t_i}\alpha t.
$$

We assume the examinator is fair in the sense that all questions can be solved within the
allotted time if one has completely mastered the material:

$$
    \sum_{i=1}^nt_i = T.
$$

Denote by $$x_i$$ the time we spend on question $$i$$. We then face the following optimization problem:

>Maximize $$\sum_{i=1}^nq_i(x_i)$$ subject to $$0 \leq x_i \leq t_i/\alpha$$ for all $$i$$ and $$\sum_{i=1}^nx_i \leq T$$.

This program basically says to maximize the number of points we score on the exam, subject to the following constraints:

* we cannot spend a negative amount of time on any question: $$x_i \geq 0$$ for all $$i$$;
* the amount of time we spend on a question is upper-bounded by the time we need for a perfect answer: $$x_i \leq t_i/\alpha$$ for all $$i$$,
because after that no more improvements are possible;
* the total time spent on all the questions must be at most the total time allowed for the exam: $$\sum_{i=1}^nx_i \leq T$$.

As an example, consider an exam consisting of four questions. The total time allotted is 90 minutes, and

$$\begin{aligned}
    p_1 &= 10 & t_1 &= 9\\
    p_2 &= 15 & t_2 &= 13.5\\
    p_3 &= 25 & t_3 &= 22.5\\
    p_4 &= 50 & t_4 &= 45
\end{aligned}$$

In total, we can earn 100 points if we answer each question perfectly within 1.5 hours.
However, say we only mastered about 80% of the material, then $$\alpha = 0.8$$ and the optimal solution is given by

$$
    x = [ 11.25, 16.875, 28.125, 33.75 ].
$$

This way, we earn a total of 80 points. Let's see what would have happened if we obeyed the ancient wisdom and solved
each question to the best of our abilities in increasing order of difficulty. It is safe to assume the number of points
is proportional to the difficulty of a question, so we would have solved each question in turn. With our 80% mastery,
this would have taken us

$$
    q = [11.25, 16.875, 28.125, 56.25].
$$

Note that this does indeed correspond to our optimal solution, where the last component is of course capped so the
total time does not exceed the allowed time. Solving every question perfectly would have taken us 112.5 minutes,
just under two hours. Interestingly,

$$
    \frac{90}{112.5} = 0.8,
$$

so our level of mastery may also be defined as the ratio $$T/T^\prime$$ where $$T^\prime$$ is the total time it
would take us to solve every question perfectly.

It may also be interesting to plot the maximum obtainable points as a function of our mastery.
Figure 1 shows what this would look like.

As we can see, there is a nice linear relationship between our mastery of the material and the maximum amount of points
we can score on an exam. If $$\alpha = .5$$, then we just barely get enough points to pass.
If $$\alpha > 1$$, then nothing substantially changes from the optimal solution for $$\alpha = 1$$: we still obtain the
maximum amount of points, but the amount of time it takes us decreases from $$T$$ to $$T/\alpha$$.

The above discussion shows that, at least in some cases, the adage that one should solve questions in increasing order
of difficulty is in fact mathematically optimal.

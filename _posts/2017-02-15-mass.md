Why are many goods much cheaper when bought in bulk as opposed to when they are bought seperately?
There is a simple mathematical model which can explain this. Suppose you are running some sort of factory
which produces some product $$p$$. To begin with, there is always a fixed cost you have to pay in order to
keep the factory itself running. This cost covers things like utility bills, employee salaries and other common expenditures.
Call this fixed cost $$b$$. Secondly, there is of course also some cost associated with the production of a single unit of $$p$$
which (I hypothesize) scales linearly with the amount of $$p$$ that is produced. Let $$a$$ be this per-unit cost. Then,
to produce $$n$$ units of $$p$$, the total cost comes down to a simple linear equation:
\begin{equation}
    c(n) = an + b.
\end{equation}
Its derivative wrt $$n$$ is easy to compute:
\begin{equation}
    c^\prime(n) = a.
\end{equation}
Now, it is plausible to assume that the per-unit cost $$a$$ is much less than the fixed cost $$b$$, i.e. $$a \ll b$$.
This means that even though the fixed cost can be very high depending on the product in question, the total cost of
production does not increase much by adding an extra unit. Intuitively, when $$n$$ is large, the unit cost will begin
to dominate the fixed cost until $$b$$ becomes negligibly small compared to $$an$$. That is the point where, if we
divide the total cost of $$n$$ units by the number of units, we end up actually paying very little per unit.
This quantity is given by
\begin{equation}
    \alpha(n) = \frac{c(n)}{n} = \frac{an + b}{n} = a + \frac{b}{n}.
\end{equation}
As $$n$$ gets larger and larger, this quantity obviously approaches $$a$$:
\begin{equation}
    \underset{n\to\infty}{\lim}\alpha(n) = a.
\end{equation}
So, as the number of units of $$p$$ ordered increases, the cost per unit of $$p$$ approaches the actual per-unit cost $$a$$.
However, when $$n$$ is small, the per-unit cost is eclipsed by the fixed cost $$b$$ which is much larger than $$a$$.
Another interesting question one may ask is when, precisely, we "reach" the limit where $$\alpha(n) = a$$.
Mathematically speaking, of course, the answer is never, but we can quantify how close we are to that limit by solving the following equation for $$n$$:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{b}{c(n)} \leq \varepsilon.
\end{equation}
Given an $$\varepsilon$$ of our choosing, solving the above for $$n$$ yields the number of units we have to order for $$a$$
to make up a fraction of at least $$1 - \varepsilon$$ of the total cost. We find

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{b}{an + b} &\leq \varepsilon\\
    \frac{an + b}{b} &\geq \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\\
    \frac{an}{b} + 1 &\geq \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\\
    n &\geq \frac{b}{a}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon} - 1 \right).
\end{aligned}

Recently, a lot of noise has been made regarding the phenomenon of "fake news", also known as "hoax news". Wikipedia summarizes the notion as follows:

>Fake news websites (also referred to as hoax news) deliberately publish hoaxes, propaganda, and disinformation purporting to be real news — often using social media to drive web traffic and amplify their effect.
Unlike news satire, fake news websites seek to mislead, rather than entertain, readers for financial, political, or other gain.

The major reason fake news is suddenly enjoying such hype is the 2016 U.S presidential election, with many people blaming Donald Trump's victory in part to fake news.
I try to make a point of keeping politics out of this blog, so I will say no more about Trump or his fans and detractors here.
Instead, I will focus on the public outcry and the supposed "solutions" to the fake news problem that appear to be gaining traction nowadays.
For example, Germany is considering to [fine social media companies](http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2016/12/19/germany-wants-facebook-to-pay-for-fake-news)
if fake news ends up being spread on their platform, and at least [Facebook appears to take this seriously](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/01/16/facebook-combating-fake-news-germany-ahead-election/).

Let's get one thing out of the way first: fake news is definitely a problem, no doubt about it.
With the rise of social media and the blogosphere, this was pretty much inevitable and is not very surprising at all.
The internet is filled with people who all want to push their own agenda, and with the power social media at their fingertips, these trolls have all they need to spread their nonsense virally.
The ramifications for democracy are clear and not very optimistic: if fake news is allowed to spread virally throughout a significant portion of the population who are prone to believing this
sort of thing without question, then you can expect this to eventually have an undesirable impact on the electorate and hence society in general.
So the question is: what can be done about it?

It has been argued that companies such as Facebook and Google should be responsible for filtering out fake news.
The solutions proposed appear to treat this like spam detection: if these companies can detect and remove spam automatically, then why not fake news as well? Should be a piece of cake.
Except it's not, for reasons which are abundantly clear to anyone who has ever seriously studied machine learning and/or spam detection.
Spam is different from fake news in several ways. Your average spam message can be detected rather easily. Here's a typical spam e-mail:

    ATTN:PRESIDENT/CEO


                        STRICTLY PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL
    I am MR.Johnson S. Abu, the bills and exchange Director at the

Spam always has a few clear red flags which allow it to be detected fairly easily in the vast majority of cases:

1. If the e-mail contains an abundance of spelling errors and grandiose claims, it's most likely spam.

2. Spam usually tries to get the user to buy some amazing product or otherwise expend money.
In this regard, some spam is also part of a scam to steal money from unsuspecting victims.

Put simply, spam messages are low-effort shitposts.
It is not hard to detect automatically using, for example, multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).
I myself have recently created an MLP which achieves an accuracy of over 99% on the [UCI Spambase dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase).
It has only three hidden layers and 15 hidden units total, so this is really not hard to do.
Fake news, on the other hand, is something else entirely, though depending on the competence of the fake news author it can resemble spam sometimes.
Compare your typical spam message to the following articles which where all actually published as news:

1. [Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide](http://abcnews.com.co/obama-executive-order-bans-pledge-of-allegiance-in-schools/)

2. [Woman arrested for defecating on boss’ desk after winning the lottery](https://thevalleyreport.com/2016/04/25/woman-arrested-for-defecating-on-boss-desk-after-winning-the-lottery/)

3. [Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President, Releases Statement](http://newsbreakshere.com/pope-francis-shocks-world-endorses-donald-trump-president-releases-statement)

Should any of these links die, the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) can always be of assistance, as well as simply Googling the titles.
The thing to note about these articles is that, to the casual eye, they appear legitimate. The first article has a picture of Obama supposedly signing the Executive Order in question;
the second article has a mugshot of the woman that was allegedly arrested. All three articles even feature interviews with the people they're about.
Yet it is all fabricated! None of these stories are real, which you can tell just by Googling the titles. The search results are filled with counter-articles exposing these posts as
the fake news they are, but a casual observer most likely won't be able to determine this just by looking at the article itself. Moreover, they probably won't even expend the extra
three minutes of effort it takes to fact-check the article; usually, people who read articles like this immediately jump on the bandwagon and hop over to Facebook or Twitter or other
social media to rant about them as if they are factual. This in turn increases the articles' impact and may lead to them going viral, which is very undesirable indeed.

You can't combat fake news with the same methods used to combat spam, for the simple reason that these articles are written by people who have sufficient journalistic experience to
be able to present their stories as if they are real. A typical fake news article won't raise any of the red flags commonly associated with spam, such as poor grammar and spelling
or trying to scam the reader into giving away money. No, they are designed to attract clicks and expose users to the ads that are the biggest source of revenue these sites have.

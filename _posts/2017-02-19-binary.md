Suppose you have an ordered list of items, such as an interval of real numbers $$[a, b]$$, and you want to find an element in that list with a particular property,
such as causing a certain function $$f$$ to be equal to zero. One way of solving such a problem is *binary search*. First, you check the element right in the middle
of $$[a,b]$$, i.e. $$\frac{a+b}{2}$$. Call this element $$x_1$$. If this element is too large, you repeat the process for the subinterval $$[a, x_1]$$; otherwise
you repeat for $$[x_1, b]$$. If we denote the $$i$$th element checked by $$x_i$$ with $$x_1 = \frac{a+b}{2}$$, then for $$i \geq 1$$ we have

$$
    x_{i+1} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
        \frac{a + x_i}{2} & \mbox{if } x_i \mbox{ is too large}\\
        \frac{x_i + b}{2} & \mbox{if } x_i \mbox{ is too small}
    \end{array}\right..
$$

One might now wonder how long it can take to find the appropriate element in the interval, given that it is actually somewhere in there. Let's represent the element
we're looking for by a random variable $$X$$ which can take on any value within $$[a,b]$$. Assume $$X$$ is uniformly distributed over the interval, then for any $$y \in [a,b]$$,
\begin{equation}
    f_X(y) = \frac{1}{b-a}.
\end{equation}
Moreover,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Pr(X \leq y) &= \int_a^yf_X(z)\mathrm{d}z = \int_a^y\frac{1}{b-a}\mathrm{d}z = \frac{y-a}{b-a}\\
    \Pr(X \geq y) &= \frac{b-y}{b-a}.
\end{aligned}
$$

We then find

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Pr(X \leq x_1) &= \frac{\frac{a+b}{2} - a}{b-a} = \frac{1}{2}\\
    \Pr(X \geq x_1) &= \frac{b - \frac{a+b}{2}}{b-a} = \frac{1}{2}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Suppose we find out that $$X \leq x_1$$, then we compute
\begin{equation}
    x_2 = \frac{a + x_1}{2}.
\end{equation}
The probability distribution on $$X$$ must then be updated to incorporate this extra information:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Pr(X \leq x_2 \mid X \leq x_1) &= \frac{\frac{a+x_1}{2} - a}{x_1-a} = \frac{1}{2}\\
    \Pr(X \geq x_2 \mid X \leq x_1) &= \frac{x_1 - \frac{a+x_1}{2}}{x_1-a} = \frac{1}{2}.
\end{aligned}
$$

The pattern should be immediately clear: we always have $$\Pr(X \leq x_i) = \Pr(X \geq x_i) = \frac{1}{2}$$ for all $$i$$ if the distribution is updated after each iteration
to incorporate our current knowledge about $$X$$. So how many iterations can we expect to run? Let $$I_n = [a_n, b_n]$$ be the interval we know $$X$$ must be in after $$n$$ iterations.
We are, however, faced with the following paradox: $$\Pr(X = x) = 0$$ for any $$x$$, since the interval $$[a,b]$$ contains uncountably many elements. So we must modify our original
question: how many iterations must we run in order to obtain the value of $$X$$ to within a specified precision $$\varepsilon$$? That is, what is the smallest $$n$$ such that
\begin{equation}
    b_n - a_n \leq \varepsilon.
\end{equation}
By construction, we have
\begin{equation}
    b_n - a_n = \frac{b-a}{2^n}.
\end{equation}
We thus find

$$
\begin{aligned}
    b_n - a_n &\leq \varepsilon\\
    \frac{b-a}{2^n} &\leq \varepsilon\\
    \frac{b-a}{\varepsilon} &\leq 2^n\\
    \log_2\frac{b-a}{\varepsilon} &\leq n\\
    \log_2(b-a) - \log_2(\varepsilon) &\leq n
\end{aligned}
$$

In a typical implementation on a computer, we will want a precision of at most $$\varepsilon = 10^{-16}$$, since that is the most floating point can give you.
If our interval is $$[0,1]$$, then we must compute
\begin{equation}
    n = -\log_2(10^{-16}).
\end{equation}
Rounded up, this evaluates to 54 iterations.
Especially note that the required number of iterations grows logarithmically in both the size of the interval and the preferred precision.
This is a very nice property to have!

In recent years, the [Bee Movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389790/) (being a total piece of garbage) has become somewhat of a meme. Specifically, a depressingly great number of Youtube videos exist along the lines of "The Bee Movie but each time they say bee it gets 2x faster". This meme has been applied to other videos as well, like the [Mine Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV0TIhYEoeE). The general template of this meme is

>Video X but each time Y happens I apply transformation $$f$$ to a parameter $$P$$ of the video.

For example, in the case of the Bee Movie, Y is the event that someone says "bee", $$P$$ is the runtime of the video and $$f$$ is simply division by two. If $$P$$ is scalar (which it usually is in these cases), we may investigate its rate of change as the video progresses. Suppose for simplicity that the event Y happens approximately $$\lambda$$ times per frame of video (so we expect it to happen once every $$1/\lambda$$ frames). If the transformation $$f$$ consists of scaling the parameter $$P$$ by a factor $$\alpha$$ (which is almost always the case), then after $$k$$ frames the parameter $$P$$ takes on the value $$\alpha^{t\lambda}P_0$$ where $$P_0$$ is the original value of $$P$$.

If $$P$$ is the number of frames per second (which is the most interesting and practical case as most of these memes simply speed up the video), then after $$k$$ frames the playback speed of the video is $$\alpha^{t\lambda}P_0$$ frames per second where $$P_0$$ is the "normal" playback speed, say 30 FPS. Clearly, for $$\alpha > 1$$, the playback speed increases exponentially with $$t$$. The natural question to ask is then: what's the runtime of the modified video?

If the original video runs at $$P_0$$ frames per second and has a total runtime of $$n$$ seconds, then it has a total of $$nP_0$$ frames. The time between the first and second frame is given by $$1/P_0$$, the time between the second and third frame is given by $$1/(\alpha^\lambda P_0)$$, etc. In general, the time between the $$k$$th and $$(k+1)$$th frame is given by $$1/(\alpha^{k\lambda}P_0)$$. The total runtime is simply the sum of the time between every consecutive pair of frames. Assuming $$\alpha \not= 1$$, this means we have a runtime of

$$
    \frac{1}{P_0}\sum_{k=1}^{nP_0}\frac{1}{\alpha^{k\lambda}} = \frac{\alpha^{-nP_0\lambda}(\alpha^{nP_0\lambda} - 1)}{P_0(\alpha^\lambda - 1)}.
$$

As an example, let's say we have an average feature-length movie ($$n = 5400$$, an hour and a half long) playing at 30 FPS ($$P_0 = 30$$), an event that occurs approximately once every five minutes at regular speed (i.e. once every 9000 frames, $$\lambda = 1/9000$$) and causes us to double the playback speed ($$\alpha = 2$$). The runtime of the modified movie is then given by

$$
    \frac{2^{-5400 \times 30 \times 1/9000}(2^{5400 \times 30 \times 1/9000} - 1)}{30 \times (2^{1/9000} - 1)} \approx 433.
$$

We went from a movie that is an hour and a half long to one that is a little over seven minutes long! Clearly this effect can get out of hand really fast. Figure 1 illustrates this phenomenon by plotting the time in seconds between consecutive frames for this example as a function of the current frame. As can be clearly seen, this drops off exponentially. Figure 2 shows the same phenomenon from a different perspective: it plots the number of frames per second the movie is playing at given the current frame number, on a logarithmic scale. Again, we clearly have an exponential growth. Even though the movie starts at 30 frames per second, at the half-way point (after 81000 frames) this has already increased to 15360 frames per second. At that point, the human brain probably can no longer make any sense of what's going on at all.

What would happen if we took the same situation as above but halved the playback speed each time instead of doubling it? This would yield a new runtime of 113462091 seconds, or about 3.6 years.

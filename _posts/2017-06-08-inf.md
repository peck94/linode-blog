I recently came across this image, which appears to have been circulating the web for quite some time already [given the amount of JPEG](https://xkcd.com/1683/):

While entertaining, this is not known to be true. This idea is based on the belief that just because a number is infinitely long and
non-repeating, it has to contain every possible sequence. As I intend to show in this post, this belief is false.

To be clear, a uniform random infinitely long real number will contain every possible finite sequence of digits with probability 1.
To see this, let $$r$$ be a real number chosen uniformly at random from the set of all infinitely long real numbers. [[^1]]
Let the binary expansion of $$r$$ be given by the sequence $$r_1, r_2, r_3, \dots$$.
By assumption, the probability that the $$i$$th bit of $$r$$ is equal to $$b$$ is precisely $$\frac{1}{2}$$.
Let $$s$$ be any finite bit string of our own choosing. We will write the different bits of $$s$$ as
$$s_1, \dots, s_n$$. The probability that $$s$$ occurs in $$r$$ at position $$i$$ is

$$
    \Pr(r_{i} \dots r_{i+n-1} = s) = 2^{-n}.
$$

The probability that $$i$$ is the first occurence of $$s$$ in $$r$$, written $$\Pr(s \in_i r)$$ for short, is

$$
    \Pr(s \in_i r) = 2^{-n}(1 - 2^{-n})^{i-1}.
$$

The probability that $$s$$ occurs *anywhere* in $$r$$ is given by the probability that it occurs somewhere
for the first time:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \sum_{i=1}^\infty \Pr(s \in_i r) &= \sum_{i=1}^\infty 2^{-n}(1 - 2^{-n})^{i-1}\\
        &= 2^{-n}\sum_{i=1}^\infty(1 - 2^{-n})^{i-1}
\end{aligned}$$

Since $$-1 < 1 - 2^{-n} < 1$$, the above series converges to

$$
    2^{-n}\frac{2^n - 1}{1 - 2^{-n}} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2^n(1 - 2^{-n})} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2^n - 1} = 1.
$$

Thus, we have that a uniform random infinitely long real number contains any finite bit string $$s$$ with probability 1.
However, $$\pi$$ is not just any uniform random real number, and at the time of this writing it is *unknown* whether it contains
every possible finite sequence of digits. Even if it did, the claim that "all information that has ever existed and will ever exist"
would be present in $$\pi$$ is arguable. Since the universe is supposed to be infinitely large, it could conceivably contain an infinite
amount of information. The encoding of all this information would then be an infinitely long string, which cannot be encoded in just any real number.
Also, it is very likely that such meaningful sequences would only occur very rarely and would require a huge amount of bits
of $$\pi$$ to be generated, probably far in excess of the storage capacity of the entire world.
So you really need not worry about converting $$\pi$$ to binary, or any real number for that matter.

As a trivial counterexample to the claims in Figure 1, consider the following real number:

$$
    r = 0.101001000100001\dots
$$

This number is constructed in an obvious manner: it is an infinite sequence of ones, but each 1 is preceded by a number of zeroes
equal to the amount of ones that came before. This number is clearly infinite and non-repeating, but it will never contain, e.g.,
the bit string 11. Hence, any finite string which contains that sequence will never occur in $$r$$. Many more such sequences can
be found, but one is enough to disprove the idea that being infinitely long and non-repeating is a sufficient condition for
containing all possible finite sequences.

[^1]: We actually don't need to add the assumption that $$r$$ is infinitely long, as a uniform random real number will almost always be infinite.

I recently noticed that a post about quantum computing on this blog is long overdue, as there haven't been any since I first posted.
This article will thus serve to correct this shortcoming.

# Preliminaries

**Braket notation**.



# Classical bits

The fundamental unit of data with which classical computers work is the *bit*.
A classical bit can be modeled as a 2-vector:

$$
    |b\rangle = \left[\begin{matrix}
        b_0\\
        b_1
    \end{matrix}\right],
$$

where $$b_0, b_1 \in \{0,1\}$$ and $$b_0 + b_1 = 1$$.
Hence there are actually only two possible states for the classical bit:

$$\begin{aligned}
    |{0}\rangle &= \left[\begin{matrix}
        1\\
        0
    \end{matrix}\right],
    &
    |{1}\rangle &= \left[\begin{matrix}
        0\\
        1
    \end{matrix}\right].
\end{aligned}$$

A bit can then be written as

$$
    |b\rangle = a|0\rangle + (1-a)|1\rangle,
$$

where $$a \in \{0,1\}$$. Thus, all classical bits satisfy

$$
    \langle b | b \rangle = 1.
$$

Of course, a single bit by itself can't do much, so we will usually consider systems of $$n$$ bits simultaneously.
We can combine the states $$|b_1\rangle, \dots, |b_n\rangle$$ of $$n$$ different bits into a single state vector
by taking the *tensor product* of the different vectors:

$$
    |\psi\rangle = |b_1\rangle \otimes \dots \otimes |b_n\rangle.
$$

This state vector will have $$2^n$$ components, with component $$i$$ equal to 1 if and only if the pattern of $$n$$
bits encodes the decimal $$i-1$$. More formally, the tensor product of two vectors

$$\begin{aligned}
    |v\rangle &= \left[\begin{matrix}
        v_1\\
        \vdots\\
        v_n
    \end{matrix}\right],
    &
    |w\rangle &= \left[\begin{matrix}
        w_1\\
        \vdots\\
        w_m
    \end{matrix}\right]
\end{aligned}$$

is defined by

$$
    |v\rangle \otimes |w\rangle = \left[\begin{matrix}
        v_1w_1\\
        v_1w_2\\
        \vdots\\
        v_1w_m\\
        v_2w_1\\
        v_2w_2\\
        \vdots\\
        v_nw_m
    \end{matrix}\right].
$$

This vector clearly has $$n \times m$$ components.
Tensor products are also defined for matrices in the obvious way.
As an example, consider a system of two bits:

$$\begin{aligned}
    |b_1\rangle &= \left[\begin{matrix}
        1\\
        0
    \end{matrix}\right],
    &
    |b_2\rangle &= \left[\begin{matrix}
        0\\
        1
    \end{matrix}\right].
\end{aligned}$$

The tensor product is given by

$$
    |b_1\rangle \otimes |b_2\rangle = \left[\begin{matrix}
        1 \times 0\\
        1 \times 1\\
        0 \times 0\\
        0 \times 1
    \end{matrix}\right] = \left[\begin{matrix}
        0\\
        1\\
        0\\
        0
    \end{matrix}\right]
$$

The two bits encode 0 and 1 respectively, so their combined state is 01.
The different components of the state vector correspond to the states 00, 01, 10 and 11 respectively.
So we see that, indeed, the component of the state vector corresponding to the state 01 is set to 1,
and all other components are set to zero.

# Operations on bits

Now that we know how to represent bits, we can study how their states may be manipulated.
The elementary operations on bits are the AND, OR and NOT operators.

**AND**. The AND operator is defined by the following matrix:

$$
    \mathrm{AND} = \left[\begin{matrix}
        1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{matrix}\right].
$$

As may be inferred from its dimensions, the AND operator is a binary operator, i.e. it takes a 2-bit state vector
as input and outputs a 1-bit state vector. One can check that the output of AND is $$|1\rangle$$ if and only if
its input is $$|1\rangle \otimes |1\rangle$$, otherwise the output is $$|0\rangle$$. As the name implies, this
operator computes the logical conjunction of its inputs.

**OR**. The OR operator is defined by the following matrix:

$$
    \mathrm{OR} = \left[\begin{matrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
        0 & 1 & 1 & 1
    \end{matrix}\right].
$$

This is just the logical disjunction of the inputs.

**NOT**. The NOT operator is defined by the following matrix:

$$
    \mathrm{NOT} = \left[\begin{matrix}
        0 & 1\\
        1 & 0
    \end{matrix}\right].
$$

This is a unary operator which flips the state of the input bit.

In general, to construct an operator which takes an $$n$$-bit state as input and outputs an $$m$$-bit state,
one needs to specify a $$2^m \times 2^n$$ boolean matrix. The columns of this matrix are the output states
corresponding to successive input states.

Composition of operators is relatively straightforward.
Let $$A$$ and $$B$$ be any two operators on bits. If we want to construct a circuit where $$A$$ and $$B$$
are applied in parallel, we simply compute their tensor product $$A \otimes B$$.
If we want to apply $$B$$ on the output of $$A$$, we compute the matrix product $$BA$$.
For instance, we can combine the NOT and AND operators to make a NAND gate:

$$
    \mathrm{NAND} = \mathrm{NOT} \cdot \mathrm{AND} = \left[\begin{matrix}
        0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{matrix}\right].
$$

If we then want to create a circuit $$C$$ which takes four bits as input and outputs the NAND of the first two bits
as well as the OR of the last two, we would have $$C = \mathrm{NAND} \otimes \mathrm{OR}$$.

# Quantum bits

A quantum bit, or *qubit*, can be seen as a generalisation of the classical bit.
A qubit is determined by a state vector $$|\psi\rangle \in \mathbb{C}^2$$ satisfying

$$
    \langle \psi | \psi \rangle = 1.
$$

Thus, qubit state vectors are unit vectors in the complex plane.
They may also be written as

$$
    |\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle,
$$

where $$\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$$ and $$|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$$.
As in the classical case, systems of multiple qubits are given by the tensor product of their respective state vectors:

$$
    |\psi\rangle = |\psi_1\rangle \otimes \dots \otimes |\psi_n\rangle.
$$

Note that a system of $$n$$ qubits corresponds to a state vector in $$\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$$.

Whereas in the classical case, a single bit can only be $$|0\rangle$$ or $$|1\rangle$$, a qubit can be almost any
linear combination of these basis vectors. This is what is called a *superposition*: a qubit may be strictly 0 or
strictly 1 or it may lie on some spectrum between 0 and 1. The components of the qubit state vector are called the
*amplitudes*, and each amplitude determines the probability that the qubit collapses to 0 or 1 upon measurement.
These probabilities can be calculated as follows. Let $$|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$$ be any qubit,
then the probability that $$|\psi\rangle$$ yields a classical zero or one bit after measurement is given by $$|\alpha|^2$$
and $$|\beta|^2$$ respectively. Hence, the requirement that the qubit state vector have unit norm is equivalent to the
requirement that these probabilities sum to one. As a concrete example, consider the qubit

$$
    |\psi\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}|0\rangle - i\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}|1\rangle.
$$

Upon measurement, there is a $$1/3$$ chance that the qubit will equal $$\mid 0\rangle$$ and a $$2/3$$ chance it will equal $$\mid 1\rangle$$.

# Operations on qubits

As in the classical case, operations on qubits are given by linear operators.
However, there is one important restriction: qubit operators must be *unitary*.
That is, a qubit operator $$U$$ must be a square complex matrix whose conjugate transpose is equal to its inverse:

$$
    U^\star U = I_n = UU^\star,
$$

where $$I_n$$ is the $$n \times n$$ identity matrix and $$U \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$$.
This restriction has the important consequence that all qubit operators are invertible.
By contrast, classical bits support operations that are clearly not invertible, such as AND and OR.
These gates do not exist in the quantum case, since their matrices are not unitary.
The NOT gate is unitary, however, so this gate is usable on qubits.

**Toffoli**. One typical quantum gate is the Toffoli gate, given by the matrix

$$
    T = \left[\begin{matrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0
    \end{matrix}\right].
$$

This is an $$8 \times 8$$ matrix, so it takes 3 qubits as input and produces 3 qubits as output.
Its operation on classical bits can be described as follows:

$$
    (b_1, b_2, b_3) \mapsto (b_1, b_2, b_3 \oplus (b_1 \wedge b_2)).
$$

The Toffoli gate maps its input bits $$b_1, b_2, b_3$$ to $$b_1, b_2$$ and the XOR of $$b_3$$ with the AND of $$b_1$$ and $$b_2$$.
The nice thing about this gate is that it is *universal*, meaning that for any boolean function whatsoever there exists a circuit
composed entirely of Toffoli gates which computes that function. Since it is also unitary, the Toffoli gate is a universal quantum gate.

**Hadamard**. One last really important gate I will discuss here is the Hadamard gate:

$$
    H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{matrix}
        1 & 1\\
        1 & -1
    \end{matrix}\right].
$$

This gate crops up in virtually every practical quantum circuit, for an ultimately very simple reason.
Consider what happens when we apply the Hadamard gate to our basis states:

$$\begin{aligned}
    H|0\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|0\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|1\rangle,\\
    H|1\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|0\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|1\rangle.
\end{aligned}$$

We end up with qubits in a 50/50 superposition of $$\mid 0\rangle$$ and $$\mid 1\rangle$$.
The Hadamard gate is also often applied to several qubits at once.
The $$n$$-qubit Hadamard transform is defined by the tensor product of $$n$$ Hadamard gates:

$$
    H^{\otimes n}\mid y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{x=0}^{2^{n+1}-1}(-1)^{x \cdot y}\mid x\rangle.
$$

The main use of the Hadamard gate is in constructing superpositions: we can start out with a qubit that is in one of the basis states
and then apply $$H$$ to get it into a superposition. Superpositions, in turn, are useful because they are the main reason why efficient
quantum algorithms exist for problems that have no known efficient classical algorithms.

However, this is emphatically *not* because superpositions mean qubits can be "both zero and one at the same time".
This is a very common misconception: lay people often appear to be under the impression that quantum computers are faster than classical
digital computers because qubits can be both zero and one at the same time, thus allowing the quantum computer to perform exponentially
more computations than a classical computer within the same time frame. Although intuitively appealing in its simplicity, this is
completely false. Quantum computers are *not* simply massively parallellized classical computers.
If this were the case, quantum computers would be better at every single task than classical computers, which is not known to be the case.
On the contrary: there are reasons to believe quantum computers may actually be *worse* at some tasks than classical computers.
More importantly, however, a qubit in a superposition of zero and one is not "zero and one at the same time"; it is
*neither zero nor one until it is measured*. As long as we don't measure the qubit, it can perform all sorts of crazy quantum mechanical
hijinx such as interfering with other qubits, which is what gives the quantum computer its power.

# The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm

I will conclude this post with a discussion of a problem for which there exists a quantum algorithm that is provably faster than any possible
deterministic classical algorithm. The problem is the following:

>Given a function $$f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$$, determine whether $$f$$ is constant or balanced.

A function $$f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$$ is said to be *constant* if it always outputs the same value for every input, i.e. either it always
outputs zero or it always outputs one. The function is  said to be *balanced* if it outputs zero on half its inputs and one on the other half.
The important thing to note about $$f$$ is that it is given to our algorithm as a *black box*, meaning we do not get any symbolic representation
of $$f$$ or access to any of its special properties whatsoever. We get an oracle which, when queried with an $$n$$-bit string, returns the value
$$f$$ takes on said input, but no more than that. Moreover, the function is guaranteed to be either constant or balanced; it won't be anything else.

Clearly, this problem is very contrived and of virtually no practical use.
But that is not the point; the point of this problem and its corresponding classical and quantum algorithms is simply to constructively prove
that quantum computers can be faster at solving certain problems than classical computers could ever be.
It also serves as a nice introduction to quantum computation.

A classical deterministic solution to this problem is to just iterate over all $$2^n$$ possible inputs for $$f$$ until we can be certain that
$$f$$ is constant or balanced. Since $$f$$ is guaranteed to be either constant or balanced, the worst-case runtime for this algorithm is
$$2^{n-1}+1$$. That is, in the worst case we have to evaluate just over half of the possible inputs.
If $$f$$ returns the same value each time, we know it must be constant; if it returns different values, it must be balanced.
The classical solution thus runs in time $$\mathcal{O}(2^n)$$.

An efficient quantum algorithm for this problem is the *Deutsch-Jozsa* algorithm.

Figure 1 illustrates the quantum circuit for this algorithm.
The algorithm starts with $$n$$ qubits in the $$\mid 0\rangle$$ state and one qubit in the $$\mid 1\rangle$$ state.
These qubits are then passed through a Hadamard transform, yielding a superposition.
The next gate, dubbed $$U_f$$, is the oracle which provides black box access to the function $$f$$.
Since quantum gates must always be unitary, this oracle is a special wrapper around $$f$$ which makes sure the transformation is reversible.
Specifically, $$U_f$$ maps its input $$\mid x_1 \dots x_n\rangle\mid y\rangle$$ to $$\mid x_1 \dots x_n\rangle\mid y \oplus f(x_1, \dots, x_n)\rangle$$.
We then essentially *ignore* the second qubit state and pass the first $$n$$ qubits through another Hadamard gate.
This output is then measured, and from this measurement we can immediately deduce whether $$f$$ is constant or balanced.

To analyze the correctness of this algorithm, we go through it step by step.
The starting state of the algorithm is

$$
    \mid \psi_1 \rangle = |0^n \rangle|1\rangle.
$$

We then apply a Hadamard transform to these qubits:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \mid \psi_2 \rangle &= (H^{\otimes n}|0^n \rangle)(H|1\rangle)\\
        &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n+1}}}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1}\mid x\rangle(\mid 0 \rangle - \mid 1 \rangle).
\end{aligned}$$

Applying the oracle then yields

$$
    \mid\psi_3\rangle = U_f|\psi_2\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n+1}}}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1}|x\rangle(|f(x)\rangle - |1 \oplus f(x)\rangle).
$$

Since $$f$$ is either zero or one, this simplifies to

$$\begin{aligned}
    \mid \psi_3 \rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n+1}}}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1}(-1)^{f(x)}|x\rangle(|0\rangle - |1\rangle).
\end{aligned}$$

Another Hadamard transform is then applied to the top $$n$$ qubits, ignoring the last qubit:

$$
    \mid\psi_4\rangle = \frac{1}{2^n}\sum_{x,y}(-1)^{f(x)}(-1)^{x \cdot y}|y\rangle.
$$

The probability of measuring $$\mid 0^n\rangle$$ at the end is given by

$$
    \left| \frac{1}{2^n}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1}(-1)^{f(x)} \right|^2.
$$

In case $$f$$ is constant, this expression evaluates to 1.
In case $$f$$ is balanced, it evaluates to 0.
Thus we have a *deterministic* quantum algorithm which can always determine, with 100% success, whether $$f$$ is balanced or constant.
How much time does this algorithm take? Whereas the classical algorithm requires $$2^{n-1}+1$$ evaluations of $$f$$ in the worst case,
the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm requires *just one evaluation of the function*. This is an exponential speedup over the classical case.
